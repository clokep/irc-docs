<w00t> jilles, how does hyperion do snomasks?
<jilles> it doesn't
<jilles> that and umodes-as-privs makes hyperion's umode system really enormous
<jilles> or are you actually asking about charybdis
<w00t> err
<w00t> yeah
<w00t> sorry, brainfreeze
<jilles> MODE <nick> +s  (enables a default set, namely +s)
<w00t> patch committed
<jilles> MODE <nick> +s <changes>
<jilles> MODE <nick> -s  (clear all)
<jilles> that's what the client can send
<w00t> +s -foo+bar?
<jilles> yeah
<jilles> snomask changes can be combined with other umodes
<w00t> i think we need to standardise on this system then
<w00t> afaik unreal's works the same way
<jilles> when sending it out to the client, charybdis will never use this syntax
<w00t> ours does too, except we currently use +n
<w00t> er.
<w00t> you don't send +s back?
<jilles> it sends +s without parameters, if it changed; then RPL_SNOMASK with the new snomask
<w00t> hmm.
<w00t> a little trippy
<jilles> RPL_SNOMASK is also send after RPL_UMODEIS if you MODE <nick>
<w00t> though
<w00t> that actually makes more sense in that perspective, yeah
<jilles> ircu works similarly, except that snomasks are decimal numbers there
